## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Focus on core typing tutor (4 practice modes, progress tracking)
- **Phase 2 (v1.2):** Polish, performance optimization, Windows/Linux
- **Phase 3 (v1.3-v1.5):** Introduce AI-powered features (below)
- **Phase 4 (v2.0+):** Advanced biometrics, VR/AR, future tech

---

## 1. AI-Powered Personalized Learning Engine 🧠⚡

### Adaptive Difficulty with ML

**Revolutionary Features:**
- **Micro-Learning**: AI identifies exactly which 2-3 letter combinations you struggle with
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Creates custom sentences focusing on your weak spots
- **Predictive Difficulty**: Knows when you're ready for the next challenge before you do
- **Learning Velocity Optimization**: Adjusts pacing to your optimal learning speed

**Technical Approach:**
```typescript
const adaptiveEngine = {
  analyzeTypingPattern: keystrokes => {
    // Identify struggling letter combinations
    const weakSpots = findWeakCombinations(keystrokes);
    // Generate targeted exercises
    return createPersonalizedDrill(weakSpots);
  },
};
```

**Why It's Unfair:** Traditional typing tutors use static lessons. Your AI creates infinite, personalized content.

**Implementation Priority:** v1.3 (High)

- **Cognitive Load Management**: Prevent mental overload with smart pacing

**Technical Approach:**
```typescript
const biometricEnhancement = {
  detectFlowState: (wpm, accuracy, consistency, heartRate) => {
    // Identify when user is in optimal learning state
    if (isInFlowState(metrics)) {
      extendSession(); // Keep them practicing longer
      increaseDifficulty(); // Push boundaries when ready
    }
  },
};
```

**Why It's Unfair:** No typing tutor currently uses biometric feedback for optimization.
