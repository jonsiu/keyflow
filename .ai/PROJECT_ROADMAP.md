Looking at your current PROJECT_ROADMAP.md in light of all our research, I need to be direct: **It needs a complete rewrite.** The current roadmap has fundamental misalignments with what the research validated. Let me break down the issues and provide a new roadmap.

## üö® **Critical Issues with Current Roadmap**

### **1. Wrong Tech Stack** ‚ùå
**Current:** "Next.js with Electron"  
**Should Be:** Tauri + React + Vite

**Why:** Our research proved:
- Electron: 180 MB installer, 350 MB RAM, 8ms latency
- Tauri: 12 MB installer, 60 MB RAM, 2ms latency
- At 200 WPM (17 keystrokes/sec), 8ms latency is unacceptable

### **2. Cloud Dependencies** ‚ùå
**Current:** "Convex for local data storage" + "Clerk for user management"  
**Should Be:** Tauri Store Plugin (truly local), no auth for MVP

**Why:** User research shows:
- "Many lack offline/multi-device support" (complaint)
- Users want offline-first
- No authentication needed for local-only MVP

### **3. Missing Strategic Positioning** ‚ùå
**Current:** Generic "typing tutor"  
**Should Be:** "Monkeytype + teaching for speed seekers"

**Why:** Research validated:
- Target market: professionals/young adults (not kids)
- Positioning: TypingClub + Monkeytype + TypeRacer in one
- QWERTY-only (fastest typists use QWERTY)

### **4. Wrong Feature Priorities** ‚ùå
**Current:** Linear phases (Core ‚Üí Exercises ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Polish)  
**Should Be:** Four practice modes from day 1

**Why:** User research: "Mix 2-3 sites to avoid plateaus"
- Need: Lesson Mode + Practice Mode + Drill Mode + Challenge Mode
- Not: Generic "exercises" that do everything poorly

### **5. Missing Go-to-Market** ‚ùå
**Current:** No launch strategy  
**Should Be:** r/typing, Product Hunt, Hacker News plan

**Why:** Research shows r/typing is where your target users are

## üöÄ **NEW PROJECT ROADMAP** (Research-Validated)

Here's the complete rewrite you should use:

```markdown
# KeyFlow - Project Roadmap

## The Native Typing Tutor for Speed Seekers

> **Mission:** Consolidate TypingClub, Monkeytype, Keybr, and TypeRacer into one beautiful, fast, native desktop app.

---

## üìä **Strategic Foundation** (Research-Backed)

### **Target Market (Phase 1)**
- **Who:** Teenagers, young adults, professionals (18-35)
- **Current Speed:** 40-80 WPM
- **Goal:** 100-150+ WPM
- **Pain Points:** 
  - Currently juggling 3-4 typing websites
  - Frustrated by ads causing lag
  - Want professional UI (not kid-focused)
  - Tired of subscriptions

### **Competitive Positioning**
> "TypingClub's lessons + Monkeytype's UX + Keybr's drills + TypeRacer's competition = KeyFlow"

**Key Differentiators:**
1. ‚úÖ Native desktop (2ms latency vs. 8ms web apps)
2. ‚úÖ All-in-one (4 practice modes, not 4 separate sites)
3. ‚úÖ Ad-free forever (no lag, no distractions)
4. ‚úÖ Professional design (Monkeytype-inspired minimal UI)
5. ‚úÖ One-time purchase ($39, not recurring subscriptions)
6. ‚úÖ QWERTY-focused (like world record holders)

### **Technical Foundation**

**Architecture:** Monorepo with shared React components

```
keyflow-monorepo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared-ui/          # Shared React components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared-core/        # Business logic, typing algorithms
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared-types/       # TypeScript definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ desktop/            # Tauri app (local-first)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/                # Next.js app (cloud-based)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/                # REST API (serves both platforms)
```

**Desktop App (Tauri):**
- **Framework:** Tauri 2.0 (thin Rust wrapper + WebView frontend)
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Business Logic:** 95%+ in React/TypeScript (NOT Rust)
- **Rust Layer:** Minimal - only for OS/file system operations
- **Storage:** Tauri Store Plugin (local-first, offline)
- **Optional:** Cloud sync via REST API

**Web App (Next.js):**
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Storage:** Cloud-only via REST API
- **Purpose:** Browser-based practice, progress tracking

**Backend (REST API):**
- **Runtime:** Node.js 20+ or Bun
- **Framework:** Express.js or Hono
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase or Neon)
- **Auth:** Clerk or Supabase Auth
- **Storage:** AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2

**Shared Stack:**
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **State:** Zustand (lightweight, fast)
- **Charts:** Recharts (progress visualization)

**Why This Architecture:**
- ‚úÖ Share 90% of React components between desktop and web
- ‚úÖ Desktop: Local-first, works 100% offline, optional cloud sync
- ‚úÖ Web: Full-featured browser app for users without desktop access
- ‚úÖ Backend: Serves web app, optional sync for desktop, enables Pro features
- ‚úÖ Tauri: 12x smaller, 4x faster, 2ms latency vs. Electron
- ‚úÖ Monorepo: Single codebase, consistent UX across platforms
- ‚úÖ React Strategy: Desktop uses React 18 (stable), Web uses React 19, shared components use React 18 APIs only

  - Contact top 100 typists on Monkeytype leaderboards
  - **KPI:** 5+ endorsements from 120+ WPM typists
- **Month 3-6:** 
  - Sponsor small typing competitions ($500-1000)
  - **KPI:** Official partnership with 1+ typing competition
- **Month 6-12:** 
  - Major competition sponsorship
  - **KPI:** Mentioned by 1+ world record holder

**Budget & ROI:**
- **Beta Phase:** $0 (free outreach, time investment only)
- **Month 1-3:** $0-500 (small community challenge sponsorship)
- **Month 3-6:** $500-1000 (small competition sponsorship)
- **Month 6-12:** $2000-5000 (major sponsorship if validated)
- **Expected ROI:** 1 endorsement from top-50 typist = 50-100 conversions ($1950-3900 revenue)

**Legal & Ethical Considerations:**
- FTC disclosure: All endorsements must disclose free access or compensation
- Genuine reviews only: Never pay for positive reviews, only for honest feedback
- Transparent metrics: All performance claims must be verifiable
- Community trust: Prioritize authentic engagement over promotional tactics

**AI Integration Angle (Competitive Differentiator):**
- **v1.3 Feature:** Adaptive AI for personalized drills based on keystroke patterns
- Position as: "The only typing tool that learns YOUR weaknesses and builds custom training"
- This could be the unique selling point that differentiates from free competitors

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Risk:** Top typists loyal to free platforms see KeyFlow as competition
  - **Mitigation:** Position as complementary tool for structured practice
- **Risk:** Rejection from monetized content creators (avoid promo overload)
  - **Mitigation:** Start with 10-15 outreaches, respect "no thanks" responses
- **Risk:** Endorsements feel inauthentic to tight-knit community
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on genuine feedback loops, never pay for fake reviews

**Key Insight:** The fastest typists are extremely particular about their tools. Success requires: (1) Technical excellence that matches their standards, (2) Authentic engagement that respects their expertise, (3) Positioning as training tool, not competition to beloved platforms, (4) Patience and persistence in building relationships.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risks & Mitigations**

### **Risk 1: Feature Creep**
**Problem:** Try to add AI, multiplayer, cloud sync in MVP  
**Mitigation:** Stick to 4 practice modes only. Say NO to everything else.

### **Risk 2: Performance Doesn't Match Claims**
**Problem:** Latency >5ms, slow startup  
**Mitigation:** Benchmark early (Week 2). If Tauri doesn't perform, we know fast.

### **Risk 3: Market Doesn't Care**
**Problem:** Users happy with free Monkeytype  
**Mitigation:** Early r/typing post (Week 4) validates demand before launch.

### **Risk 4: Pricing Too High**
**Problem:** $39 seems expensive vs. free tools  
**Mitigation:** Emphasize "no ads, no lag, own forever" + early-bird $29.

### **Risk 5: macOS-Only Limits Market**
**Problem:** Lose Windows/Linux users  
**Mitigation:** Clear roadmap showing Windows next (Month 4-5).

## üöÄ **Immediate Next Steps** (This Week)

### **Day 1-2: Monorepo & Architecture Setup**
1. [ ] Create monorepo structure (Turborepo or Nx)
2. [ ] Set up shared packages structure:
   - `packages/shared-ui` (React components)
   - `packages/shared-core` (business logic)
   - `packages/shared-types` (TypeScript definitions)
3. [ ] Configure TypeScript path aliases and build pipeline
4. [ ] Set up package dependencies and workspace linking
5. [ ] Initialize version control and CI/CD basics

### **Day 3-5: Core Typing Component (Shared)**
6. [ ] Create basic typing interface component in `shared-ui`
7. [ ] Implement keystroke validation logic (performance.now() for latency)
8. [ ] Add WPM calculation utilities (rolling average)
9. [ ] Add accuracy calculation utilities
10. [ ] Test component in isolation (Storybook optional)
11. [ ] Benchmark: Is latency <2ms? (critical validation)

### **Day 6-7: Desktop & Backend Bootstrap**
12. [ ] **Desktop:** Create Tauri app in `apps/desktop`
13. [ ] **Desktop:** Import shared typing component
14. [ ] **Desktop:** Set up Tauri Store for local persistence
15. [ ] **Backend:** Initialize Express/Hono server in `backend/`
16. [ ] **Backend:** Set up PostgreSQL schema (users, sessions, progress)
17. [ ] **Backend:** Create basic auth endpoint (Clerk/Supabase)
18. [ ] Test end-to-end: Desktop app uses shared component, stores data locally

**By end of week:** 
- ‚úÖ Monorepo building successfully
- ‚úÖ Shared typing component working
- ‚úÖ Desktop app consuming shared component
- ‚úÖ Backend API scaffold ready

## üìã **Decision Log**

### **Key Architectural Decisions (Research-Validated)**

| Decision | Rationale | Research Source |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Tauri over Electron** | 12x smaller, 4x faster, 2ms latency | Performance benchmarks |
| **Monorepo architecture** | Share 90% of code between desktop and web | Code reuse strategy |
| **Desktop + Web (not mobile)** | Desktop = local-first performance, Web = accessibility | Platform analysis |
| **Local-first desktop** | Users want offline, no lag, full control | User reviews |
| **Backend API from MVP** | Enable web app, optional desktop sync, Pro features | Multi-platform strategy |
| **QWERTY-only (MVP)** | All speed records on QWERTY, target market uses it | Layout research |
| **Four practice modes** | Users mix 3-4 sites currently | User reviews ("mix 2-3 sites") |
| **macOS first** | Premium market, validate before expansion | Strategic analysis |
| **One-time pricing** | Subscription fatigue (Typesy complaint) | User reviews |
| **Monkeytype-inspired UI** | "Gold standard" for fast typists | User reviews |
| **Professional design** | TypingClub "feels juvenile" for adults | User reviews |
| **No ads ever** | "Ads cause lag" even on high-end devices | User reviews |

## üéØ **Bottom Line**

**Old Roadmap:** Generic typing tutor with Electron, no component sharing  
**New Roadmap:** Multi-platform typing tutor with shared React components

**Key Architecture Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ **Monorepo:** Share 90% of code between desktop and web
2. ‚úÖ **Tauri (not Electron):** 12x smaller, 4x faster for desktop app
3. ‚úÖ **Desktop + Web:** Two platforms from day 1 (not desktop-only)
4. ‚úÖ **Backend API:** REST API enables web app and optional desktop sync
5. ‚úÖ **Local-first desktop:** Works 100% offline, optional cloud sync
6. ‚úÖ **Cloud-based web:** Browser-based for accessibility

**Key Product Decisions (Research-Validated):**
1. ‚úÖ Four practice modes (not generic exercises)
2. ‚úÖ QWERTY-only (strategic focus)
3. ‚úÖ Monkeytype-inspired UI (not generic)
4. ‚úÖ macOS first (validate, then expand)
5. ‚úÖ Clear go-to-market (r/typing, Product Hunt)
6. ‚úÖ One-time pricing (not subscription-only)

**Timeline:** 8 weeks to MVP, launch Month 3

**Next Step:** Set up monorepo TODAY and create shared typing component.
