# Progress Dashboard Diagrams

This directory contains architectural diagrams for the Progress Dashboard feature. Each diagram serves a specific purpose in understanding different aspects of the feature.

## Diagram Overview

### 1. **User Journey Map** (`user-journey.puml`)
**Purpose**: Shows how users discover, interact with, and benefit from the progress dashboard.

**Audience**: Product managers, designers, stakeholders, developers

**Key Insights**:
- **Discovery Phase**: How users find the dashboard after completing typing sessions
- **Exploration Phase**: How users explore their data and identify patterns
- **Interaction Phase**: How users filter data, drill down into weak keys, and export data
- **Achievement Phase**: How gamification motivates continued practice
- **Return Journey**: How users become regular progress trackers

**Success Metrics**:
- Dashboard viewed by 80%+ of users
- Average session time: 2+ minutes
- Export functionality used by 20%+
- Achievement system increases practice frequency by 15%

### 2. **Data Model** (`data-model.puml`)
**Purpose**: Defines the core entities, relationships, and data structures for the progress dashboard.

**Audience**: Backend developers, database designers, API developers

**Key Components**:
- **Core Entities**: User, TypingSession, Exercise, KeystrokeEvent
- **Analytics Entities**: ProgressStats, WeakKeyAnalysis, Achievement, UserAchievement
- **Dashboard Entities**: ChartDataPoint, DashboardFilters, ExportOptions
- **Enums**: PracticeMode, DifficultyLevel, FingerType, etc.

**Key Relationships**:
- User has many TypingSessions
- TypingSession contains many KeystrokeEvents
- User has one ProgressStats (aggregated)
- User has many WeakKeyAnalyses (AI-generated)
- User has many UserAchievements (gamification)

**Design Principles**:
- **Normalized Structure**: Efficient storage and querying
- **Aggregated Analytics**: Pre-calculated for performance
- **Extensible Enums**: Easy to add new modes, difficulties, etc.
- **Audit Trail**: Timestamps and versioning for all entities

### 3. **API Contract** (`api-contract.puml`)
**Purpose**: Defines the communication protocol between frontend and backend systems.

**Audience**: Frontend developers, backend developers, integration teams

**Key Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/dashboard/sessions` - Fetch user session history
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Get aggregated progress statistics
- `GET /api/dashboard/weak-keys` - Retrieve weak key analysis
- `GET /api/dashboard/achievements` - Get user achievements
- `POST /api/dashboard/export` - Export data in various formats
- `WebSocket /ws/dashboard` - Real-time updates

**Key Features**:
- **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Pagination Support**: Efficient data loading for large datasets
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Flexible query parameters
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live data
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with retry logic
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security

### 4. **Data Flow Sequence** (`data-flow-sequence.puml`)
**Purpose**: Shows the detailed sequence of interactions during dashboard initialization and user interactions.

**Audience**: Developers implementing the dashboard, QA testers, system architects

**Key Flows**:
- **Dashboard Initialization**: Complete startup sequence
- **Chart Data Processing**: How data is processed for visualization
- **Weak Key Analysis**: AI-powered analysis workflow
- **User Interactions**: Filter changes, exports, drill-downs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery
- **Background Sync**: Data synchronization between platforms

## Diagram Usage Guidelines

### **For Product Planning**
- Use **User Journey Map** to understand user needs and pain points
- Identify opportunities for improvement in the user experience
- Plan feature prioritization based on user value

### **For Technical Planning**
- Use **Data Model** to design database schema and API responses
- Use **API Contract** to plan frontend-backend integration
- Use **Data Flow Sequence** to understand system interactions

### **For Development**
- Use **Data Model** as reference for TypeScript interfaces
- Use **API Contract** as specification for API implementation
- Use **Data Flow Sequence** to understand component interactions

### **For Testing**
- Use **User Journey Map** to create user acceptance tests
- Use **API Contract** to create API integration tests
- Use **Data Flow Sequence** to create end-to-end tests

## Diagram Maintenance

### **When to Update**
- **User Journey Map**: When user flows change or new features are added
- **Data Model**: When new entities are added or relationships change
- **API Contract**: When new endpoints are added or existing ones change
- **Data Flow Sequence**: When system interactions change

### **Version Control**
- All diagrams are version controlled with the codebase
- Changes should be reviewed in pull requests
- Diagrams should be updated alongside code changes

### **Documentation Sync**
- Keep diagrams in sync with implementation
- Update diagrams when requirements change
- Remove outdated diagrams when features are deprecated

## Tools and Standards

### **PlantUML Syntax**
- All diagrams use PlantUML syntax for consistency
- Diagrams can be rendered in most documentation systems
- Use consistent styling and color schemes

### **Rendering**
- Diagrams can be rendered using PlantUML tools
- Many IDEs have PlantUML plugins for live preview
- Documentation systems like GitBook, Notion support PlantUML

### **Best Practices**
- Keep diagrams focused on a single concept
- Use clear, descriptive names for all elements
- Include notes and annotations for complex flows
- Maintain consistent visual styling across all diagrams

## Questions or Issues

If you have questions about these diagrams or need to make changes:

1. **For User Journey**: Consult with product managers and designers
2. **For Data Model**: Work with backend developers and database designers
3. **For API Contract**: Coordinate with frontend and backend teams
4. **For Data Flow**: Review with system architects and QA teams

Remember: These diagrams are living documents that should evolve with the feature. Keep them updated and accurate!
