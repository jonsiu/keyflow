# User Onboarding - Feature Requirements

## Overview

The User Onboarding feature provides a comprehensive initial assessment system for new KeyFlow users. It establishes a baseline typing performance profile that serves as the foundation for all future progress tracking, personalized recommendations, and achievement systems.

## Strategic Context

**User Research Validation:**
- "Users need to understand their starting point to appreciate progress" (typing assessment best practices)
- "Initial assessment should be comprehensive but not overwhelming" (user experience research)
- "Baseline data enables personalized learning paths" (adaptive learning research)

**Business Value:**
- Establishes data foundation for progress tracking
- Enables personalized user experience from day one
- Provides motivation through clear starting benchmarks
- Differentiates from basic typing sites with professional assessment
