People who type at high speeds (typically 100+ WPM) often attribute their skills to consistent, deliberate practice over time, starting with building accuracy before pushing for speed. Many began with basic touch-typing lessons in school or online, but advanced by focusing on weak areas like specific keys, punctuation, or complex word patterns. For instance, one common path is starting slow (e.g., 25-40 WPM) to achieve near-perfect accuracy, then gradually increasing speed through repetition and varied exercises. They emphasize proper posture, finger placement, and avoiding looking at the keyboard, which helps enter a "flow state" where thoughts translate directly to text without interruptions.

To reach high speeds, many report practicing daily for weeks or months, alternating between focused drills and real-world application. Some credit early exposure like high school typing classes on typewriters, followed by years of reinforcement through work, gaming, or online forums. Programmers and writers, in particular, note that frequent coding, note-taking, or content creation (e.g., blogging, social media posts) provided natural practice, boosting speeds from 40-70 WPM to 100+ over time. One user went from 45 to 100 WPM in steps like learning touch typing, practicing weak keys, and using timed tests. Others highlight breaking plateaus by targeting specific challenges, like typing common English words repeatedly or mixing in harder vocabulary.

For practice content, high-WPM typists often move beyond basic alphabet drills to more engaging or challenging material that simulates real use cases. Here's a breakdown of popular types and examples:

- **Random words and quotes**: Sites like Monkeytype offer modes with English 1k (the 1,000 most common words), short bursts (25-50 words), or quotes from books/movies. These help with rhythm and accuracy at high speeds, as shorter words and no punctuation allow for faster flow. Keybr.com is favored for adaptive drills on weak letters, which helped one user improve in the 100+ WPM range after just weeks of irregular practice.

- **Timed passages and tests**: 1-5 minute tests on Typing.com or Ratatype with varied text (e.g., fiction excerpts, news articles) build endurance. Advanced users aim for 100% accuracy at escalating speeds, often tracking progress over months (e.g., one hit 74 WPM top after 4,000+ tests).

- **Games and interactive content**: Typing of the Dead (a zombie-shooting game where you type words to "kill" enemies) is a classic for motivation— one person credited it (plus message boards) for jumping from under 30 to 70-80 WPM. Typeracer or 10FastFingers add competition with races against others using random text or code snippets.

- **Domain-specific material**: Programmers practice typing code (e.g., Python or JavaScript snippets) on sites like HackerRank or custom Monkeytype modes, as it mirrors work and improves efficiency. Writers or students use long-form content like book chapters, philosophy texts, or even transcribing audio (e.g., podcasts at high speeds for captioning practice). For variety, some incorporate foreign languages, shorthand, or specialized vocab (e.g., medical terms for professionals).

- **Real-life application**: Beyond drills, typing emails, journal entries, or brainstorming notes without corrections helps enter a flow state, even if initial output is messy (AI can clean it up later). This is especially useful for maintaining speeds above 120 WPM in practical scenarios.

Overall, the key is variety to avoid boredom—mix short sprints for speed with longer sessions for stamina, and track metrics like WPM and accuracy weekly. Tools like these are free and accessible, with communities on Reddit (e.g., r/typing) sharing progress and tips. If you're already fast, focus on edge cases like numbers, symbols, or multilingual text to push further.

**The fastest typists in the world overwhelmingly use QWERTY, not alternative layouts like Dvorak or Colemak.** 

- **Current top performers (unofficial records on sites like Monkeytype/Typeracer)**: MythicalRocket holds records like 305 WPM (15s) and 293 WPM, explicitly on QWERTY.  Anthony "Chak" Ermolin (2020 Ultimate Typing Champion) and Sean Wrona (multiple titles, 200+ WPM peaks) also use QWERTY exclusively—Wrona has stated switching would cost him too much speed. 
- **Historical records**: Stella Pajunas-Garnand's 216 WPM (1946, IBM electric) was on QWERTY.  Barbara Blackburn's 212 WPM peak (Dvorak) was listed in Guinness (1976–1986) but later removed as unverified/no live demo; it was promoted by Dvorak advocates without official testing. 
- **Why not alternatives for records?** QWERTY's ubiquity means more practitioners and competition—top 10 in events like Ultimate Typing Championship are all QWERTY.  Alternatives reduce finger travel (e.g., Dvorak/Colemak ~2-3x less than QWERTY in theory) for comfort/endurance, but max speed depends more on practice than layout once proficient.  Switching resets muscle memory (3-6+ months to match prior speed), so competitors stick with QWERTY. 

**Layout choice isn't crucial for them—practice trumps it.** Even alt-layout users like MythicalRocket (200+ WPM on Colemak/Canary) set records on QWERTY.  For high-WPM typists, it's "not intrinsically faster" due to small sample sizes. 

**People who like changing layouts are typically:**
| Type                  | Why They Switch                                                                 | Common Layouts Tried                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Programmers/Dev**  | Better symbol access, less strain; preserve shortcuts (e.g., Programmer Dvorak). | Colemak-DH, Workman, QWPR             |
| **Ergonomics Seekers**| RSI/wrist pain relief; reduced motion for long sessions.                       | Dvorak, Colemak, Norman               |
| **Optimizers/Geeks** | Experiment for efficiency; smugness of "better" setup.                          | Gallium, Canary, Sturdy, custom       |
| **Multilingual**     | Native + English/programming needs; easy accents + symbols.                     | US Intl, EurKEY, Bépo                 |
| **Enthusiasts**      | Curiosity, communities (e.g., Reddit r/KeyboardLayouts).                        | Any alt; layer-switching on split KB  | They're often tinkerers who accept the retraining cost (~100 hours to proficiency) for long-term gains, especially if typing is their job/hobby. Casual users rarely bother due to shared computers and minimal speed limits.
