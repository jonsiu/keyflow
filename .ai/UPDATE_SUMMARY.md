## ✅ ENGINEERING_REQUIREMENTS.md - Major Changes

### 1. **Project Vision & Positioning** (UPDATED)

**Before:**
- Generic "Typesy Killer" positioning
- "Multi-Platform Excellence: Web, desktop, and mobile"
- No specific target market

**After:**
- **Strategic Positioning:** "TypingClub's lessons + Monkeytype's UX + Keybr's drills + TypeRacer's competition = KeyFlow"
- **Target Market:** Speed seekers (18-35 years old, 40-150+ WPM)
- **Core Value Props:** Native desktop performance (2ms latency), All-in-one platform, Professional design, Local-first architecture, AI-powered personalization, No ads ever, 90% code reuse

### 2. **Technical Architecture** (COMPLETELY REWRITTEN)

- **Technology Stack:** 
  - Desktop: Tauri 2.0 (NOT Electron)
  - Web: Next.js 15
  - Backend: Express/Hono + PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Cross-Platform Considerations:** React 19 guidelines, Framer Motion best practices, Zustand sync patterns, Tauri IPC guidelines
- **Data Sync Architecture:** Local-first with optional cloud sync, conflict resolution strategy

**Removed:**
- All Electron references
- Web Dashboard as secondary focus (now full web app)
- Socket.io for real-time (not needed for MVP)

### 3. **MVP Requirements** (RESTRUCTURED)

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Shared Components (Weeks 1-2)
**Added:**
- **Monorepo Setup:** Turborepo/Nx configuration (NEW)
- **Shared Typing Interface Component:** In packages/shared-ui (NEW)
- **Keystroke Dynamics Data Collection:** For future ML features (NEW)
- **Desktop App Bootstrap:** Tauri setup (REPLACED Electron)
- **Backend API Bootstrap:** Express/Hono + PostgreSQL (NEW)

#### Phase 2: Four Practice Modes (Weeks 3-4)
**Completely Rewritten to Match Research:**

1. **Lesson Mode** (replaces TypingClub)
   - User validation: "TypingClub for structure, but professional UI for adults"
   - Adaptive accuracy thresholds (NOT rigid 96-98%)
   - 50+ lessons covering home row → full keyboard
   - Professional UI (not juvenile)

2. **Practice Mode** (replaces Monkeytype)
   - User validation: "Monkeytype is the 'gold standard'"
   - Customizable durations (30s, 60s, 120s, 300s)
   - Content: Common 1K words, quotes, code snippets
   - Minimal, distraction-free UI

3. **Drill Mode** (replaces Keybr)
   - User validation: "Keybr's adaptive drills valued, but repetitive"
   - AI identifies weak keys (statistical analysis)
   - REAL words (not nonsense like Keybr)
   - Visual finger guidance

4. **Challenge Mode** (replaces TypeRacer)
   - User validation: "TypeRacer's competition boosts speed"
   - Daily challenges
   - Personal leaderboards
   - Natural sentences

5. **Virtual Keyboard Component**
   - Shared component in packages/shared-ui
   - QWERTY only (MVP)
   - Hand position guidance

#### Phase 3: Analytics & Web App (Weeks 5-6)
**Restructured:**

- **Backend REST API:** Complete implementation with all endpoints

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
**Updated:**
- **AI-Powered Exercise Generation (v1.3):** TensorFlow.js, keystroke dynamics analysis
- Removed: Generic "Advanced Features" phases
- Added: Clear post-MVP timeline

### 4. **Keystroke Dynamics & ML** (NEW SECTION)

**Added comprehensive data collection specifications:**
```typescript
interface TypingDataPoint {
  // Timing metrics
  keystroke: string;
  timestamp: number;
  dwellTime: number;              // How long key was held
  interKeyInterval: number;       // Time since last keystroke
  
  // Context metrics
  expectedChar: string;
  isCorrect: boolean;
  attemptNumber: number;
  position: number;
  
  // Session metrics
  currentWPM: number;
  currentAccuracy: number;
  sessionTime: number;
  fatigueScore: number;
  
  // Anonymized metadata
  sessionId: string;
  exerciseType: 'lesson' | 'practice' | 'drill' | 'challenge';
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
}
```

**Privacy-first approach:**
- Local-first storage
- Opt-in cloud sync
- Anonymized data
- Never capture actual text content

## 📝 **Post-Update Clarifications (Technical Accuracy)**

### React Version Strategy Clarification

**Original Issue:** Documentation incorrectly stated React 19 for desktop app

**Corrected Approach:**
- **Desktop (Tauri):** React 18 (stable, proven with Vite)
- **Web (Next.js):** React 19 (Next.js 15 optimized)
- **Shared Components (packages/shared-ui):** React 18 APIs only
  - No server components
  - No React 19 Actions
  - Pure client-side components

**Rationale (from tech-considerations.md):**
> "Some React 19 APIs (like Actions, React Compiler) may not yet be fully stable in non-Next.js runtimes (like Vite/Tauri)."

### Tauri "Rust Backend" Clarification

**Original Issue:** "Rust backend" terminology was misleading

**Corrected Understanding:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   FRONTEND (WebView)                    │
│   - React 18 + TypeScript               │
│   - 95%+ of your code lives here        │
│   - All business logic                  │
│   - WPM calculations, validation        │
│   - Weak key detection                  │
│   - State management (Zustand)          │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │ IPC (rare, coarse-grained)
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   RUST WRAPPER (Tauri Core)             │
│   - Minimal Rust code                   │
│   - Only for OS/file system:            │
│     • Tauri Store (save/load)           │
│     • Window management                 │
│     • System tray                       │
│     • File exports                      │
│   - NOT your business logic             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Points:**
1. ✅ **95%+ of code is React/TypeScript** (NOT Rust)
2. ✅ **Rust is minimal** - just OS/file system bridge
3. ✅ **All business logic in React** - typing engine, analytics, UI
4. ✅ **Tauri IPC used sparingly** - save sessions, export data, NOT per-keystroke

**What You'll Write in Rust (Very Little):**
```rust
// Just thin wrappers around Tauri APIs
#[tauri::command]
async fn save_session(data: String) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Delegate to Tauri Store
    Ok(())
}

#[tauri::command]  
async fn export_data(format: String) -> Result<String, String> {
    // Use file system APIs
    Ok(exported_data)
}
```

**What You'll Write in React/TypeScript (Everything Else):**
- Typing interface components
- WPM calculation algorithms
- Keystroke validation logic
- Weak key detection (statistical analysis)
- Progress tracking
- Analytics dashboard
- All four practice modes
- State management
- UI components

### Files Updated with These Clarifications

1. **ENGINEERING_REQUIREMENTS.md**
   - Desktop App section: React 18 (not 19), clarified Rust layer minimal
   - Cross-Platform Considerations: Added React version strategy
   - Updated IPC guidance: Coarse-grained only

2. **PROJECT_ROADMAP.md**
   - Technical Foundation: React 18 for desktop, React 19 for web
   - Architecture section: Added React strategy note
   - Clarified Rust layer purpose

3. **UPDATE_SUMMARY.md** (this file)
   - Added post-update clarifications section
   - Documented rationale for changes

### Package.json Recommendations

```json
// packages/shared-ui/package.json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0",     // Accept both
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"
  }
}

// apps/desktop/package.json (Tauri)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",      // Stable React 18
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "vite": "^5.0.0"
  }
}

// apps/web/package.json (Next.js)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^15.0.0",
    "react": "^19.0.0",      // Next.js optimized for React 19
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0"
  }
}
```

## ✅ **Documentation Now Technically Accurate**

All documentation now reflects:
1. ✅ React 18 for Tauri desktop (stable)
2. ✅ React 19 for Next.js web (optimized)
3. ✅ Shared components use React 18 APIs only
4. ✅ Tauri Rust layer is minimal (OS/file system bridge)
5. ✅ 95%+ of code is React/TypeScript, NOT Rust
6. ✅ All business logic in React/TypeScript
7. ✅ IPC used sparingly for coarse-grained operations

**Ready to build with accurate technical understanding!** 🎯
